# em_casing
 Compute electromagnetic fields in the presence of a vertical casing.

 halfspace.py has everything you need to compute current in a casing due to a horizontal grounded wire.

 halfspace_empymod.py requires that empymod be installed (https://empymod.github.io). You'll need it to compute fields due to the casing.

 TODO:
 Compute magnetic fields
 Include multiple casings
 Add example of computing fields
